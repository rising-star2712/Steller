# Deck Generator

Welcome to the Deck Generator application! This AI-powered application utilizes stable diffusion and LLMs to generate customizable presentations similar to Tome. With the Deck Generator, you can create unique and personalized presentations with ease.

#### Note:
The current version of the app uses the `openai` API, but version 2 will incorporate open-source models once we address the following challenges:
1. Utilizing a large model without encountering memory issues on Colab.
2. Identifying a smaller model that can generate satisfactory content.
